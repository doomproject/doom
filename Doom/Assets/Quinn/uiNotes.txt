Ideally, the shield should fill radially. (Like a pie chart.)

The health bar will fill from left to right, but the outline will stay stagnant. Keep healthBarFill behind healthBarOutline.

When the gun is selected, the triangle at the top of the box will point to it. 

The gun as well as the box will grow slightly. (Probably by about 2 or 3 according to Unity's means of measurement, keep this public in case my memory isn't right.)

The ammo icon will change according to the weapon equipped, and the grappling ammo will always be shown to the right of it. 

Haven't gotten more than one ammo icon yet, and I'd like for text to show how much ammo the player has as a fraction to the right of each icon. (Magazine/Total Held, Pistol won't have this fraction. Just a flat 5.)

Don't mind the random red colors on the PSD of the HUD, I just put those there to make sure the outlines I made for some of the assets looked good. But the PSD is also a blueprint for where everything is supposed to go.
** Still need to think about how the knife is communicated when thrown as well as its cooldown.
** Would it be too much to add a little bit of light to nearby ammo pickups + the knife?
