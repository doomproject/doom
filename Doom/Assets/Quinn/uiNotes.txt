Ideally, the shield should fill radially. (Like a pie chart.)

The sprite for the shield should change from fullShield to notFullShield when the shield is less than the maximum.

The health bar will fill from left to right, but the outline will stay stagnant.

The text will give the amount of health a numerical value as a fraction. (ex. 75/100)

** These parts haven't been implemented yet, I'll add these when I'm on a computer with the right aspect ratio.**

When the gun is selected, the triangle at the top of the box will point to it. 

The gun as well as the box will grow slightly. (Probably by about 10 according to Unity's means of measurement)

The ammo icon will change according to the weapon equipped, and the grappling ammo will always be shown to the right of it.

Don't mind the random red colors on the PSD of the HUD, I just put those there to make sure the outlines I made for some of the assets looked good.
** Still need to think about how the knife is communicated when thrown as well as its cooldown.
** Would it be too much to add a little bit of light to nearby ammo pickups + the knife?
